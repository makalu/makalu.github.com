      <big>
        From the design and development of new products, to targeted improvements of existing ones, we add value across the complete product lifecycle.
      </big>
    </p>
    <!--
    <p>
      Some customers hire us for greenfield projects, while others hire us to focus on specific challenges. Google engaged us to create an online game anchoring a cross-marketing campaign with Virgin America, while Referral Exchange engaged us to increase landing-page conversion through design optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
      What’s special about Makalu is our cross-discipline capabilities—our designer is highly skilled in development, while our developer is highly skilled in design. This combination allows us to extend “design” deeply into the domain of “how it works”—differentiating products that look nice, from those that deliver results.

      <h4>Product & UI/UX Design</h4>
      <p>
        Design is everything—how it looks, how it reads, how it engages, how it works—and is at the core of everything we do. Take a peek at our process in these articles about our <a href="/ideas/reinventing-the-investment-calculator.html">investment calculator</a> and <a href="/ideas/chessdrop-design-details.html">ChessDrop</a>.

      <h4>Front-End Development</h4>

        We’re skilled at implementing front-end design in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for both desktop and mobile environments. Our most recent product was built with React.

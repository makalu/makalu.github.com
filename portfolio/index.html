      <h3>Letters 2 President 2.0</h3>
      <p>
         We designed, developed and operated Letters 2 President 2.0, for the National Writing Project. The platform—built with Phoenix and Elixir—allowed over 12,000 American students from nearly 400 schools to publish letters to the candidates of the 2016 US presidential election.

      <p>
        Using React and Meteor, we built a cloud-based personal chess database called <a href="http://chessdrop.com">ChessDrop</a> to record, analyze, and annotate your games. If you’re into design, we think you'll enjoy reading this deep dive into some of the fresh ways we solved some old problems.

      <h3>Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur</h3>
      <p>
        Over the course of a decade, we were the design and tech team for the Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur, as they grew from startup to become the world’s fifth largest promoter, and ultimately being acquired by the world’s largest, Live Nation.

      <h3>Music Festival Apps</h3>
      <p>
       Today’s festival goers expect a great companion app, and that’s exactly what we created for Marek Lieberberg. To provide a consistent cross-platform user experience, we made extensive use of webviews in the iOS and Android mobile festival apps, while reserving the use of native technology for key areas like venue mapping.

        Makalu’s place bookmarking iOS app took the world by storm when it launched in 2014. It was picked as one of the top apps by Apple and was featured on the App Store home page. That’s like winning the lottery!

      <h3>Day in the Cloud</h3>
      <p>
        One of our proudest moments was hearing Ogilvy executives refer to the game we created for the Google & Virgin America “Day in the Cloud” campaign as, “an example of the future of marketing.” Back when Flash was the only game in town, we built our game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript—making it playable in the bandwidth-contrained environment of airplane wifi at 30,000 feet.

      <h3>Catalog Choice</h3>
      <p>
        Engaged by a group of environmentalists from New York and California in 2007, we were hired to design, build and operate the original Catalog Choice site—a Rails app that we scaled to support over one million members in its first year, and was covered by all major US media outlets. It was our first big hit!

      <p>
        Having transitioned the Catalog Choice project to the non-profit formed to manage the successful product, Makalu was later re-engaged to design and develop the service’s companion iOS app, allowing its 1.5 million members to instantly opt out of junk mail using their iPhones.

      <p>
        A current activity at Makalu is the development of the second generation of our RaceSplitter product, extending its scope from timing to event organization and management. Due for launch in 2016, we believe it’ll change the face of small event organization!

      <h3>Highend Agents</h3>
      <p>
        The majority of high-end real estate deals are facilitated by the top 5% of agents. Highend Agents brings this select group together to offer unprecedented value to property buyers and sellers. Through an iterative design process, Makalu doubled the conversion rate on Highend Agents’s landing pages, resulting in millions of dollars of increased revenue.

      <p>
        Dipping our toes into self-publication, our co-founder, Matt, wrote an introduction to investing—called, “Money for Something”—that can be read in an hour, and was praised by people like Derek Sivers and David Heinemeier Hansson. To facilitate direct sales, we built a small Rails app that integrates with Gumroad.
